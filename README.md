the homework is option 2 Pymaceuticals and option 1 Pyber. If you can only evaluate one of the two, please go with Pymaceuticals
## Pymaceuticals
### Metastatic Response to Treatment
I believe that the 3rd table in homework section Metastatic Response to Treatment is incorrect. It is a copy of the previous section. This should  be a reformat of the standard error of metastatic sites, which produces mostly numbers below 1. The table in the homework is showing in the 40-50 range.
## Pyber
### Alternative approach
Please note alternative approach to 'Bubble Plot of Ride Sharing Data' exercise in pyber-other approach.ipynb
I know Cam stated in class that comprehension tends to not be very readable. I actually find it more concise and more readable (probably depending on what all is in there).
### Testing 
Please ignore pyber-Copy1.ipynb. It was used for the alternative approach.
