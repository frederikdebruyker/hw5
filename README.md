the homework is option 1 Pyber.
Additional actions on option 2 are for practice only

## Pyber
### Squish
Please note that I requested help on the perceived 'squish' of the pie chart. I tried several alternatives to no avail:
- figsize
- axis
- axes

You will find remnants of the tries in the code. Angle serves a different purpose, so not mentioned above.

I understood from the teaching team that the 'squish' is not part of the homework and is probably a misrepresentation through gitlab.

### Alternative approach
Please note alternative approach to 'Bubble Plot of Ride Sharing Data' exercise in pyber-other approach.ipynb
I know Cam stated in class that comprehension tends to not be very readable. I actually find it more concise and more readable (probably depending on what all in in there).

### Testing 
Please ignore pyber-Copy1.ipynb. It was used for the alternative approach.
