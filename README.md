the homework is option 1 Pyber.
Additional actions on option 2 are for practice only

Pyber
Please note that I requested help on the perceived 'squish' of the pie chart. I tried several alternatives to no avail:
- figsize
- axis
- axes

You will find remnants of the tries in the code. Angle serves a different purpose, so not mentioned above.

I understood from the teaching team that the 'squish' is not part of the homework and is probably a misrepresentation through gitlab.
