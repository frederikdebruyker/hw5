# hw5
the homework is option 1 Pyber and option 2 Pymaceuticals (currently missing first drug pending question with teaching staff, but otherwise complete).

## Pyber
### Squish
Please note that I requested help on the perceived 'squish' of the pie chart. I tried several alternatives to no avail:
- figsize
- axis
- axes

You will find remnants of the tries in the code. Angle serves a different purpose, so not mentioned above.
I understood from the teaching team that the 'squish' is not part of the homework and is probably a misrepresentation through gitlab.
### Alternative approach
Please note alternative approach to 'Bubble Plot of Ride Sharing Data' exercise in pyber-other approach.ipynb
I know Cam stated in class that comprehension tends to not be very readable. I actually find it more concise and more readable (probably depending on what all is in there).
### Testing 
Please ignore pyber-Copy1.ipynb. It was used for the alternative approach.

## Pymaceuticals
### Metastatic Response to Treatment
I believe that the 3rd table in homework section Metastatic Response to Treatment is incorrect. It is a copy of the previous section. This should  be a reformat of the standard error of metastatic sites, which produces mostly numbers below 1. The table in the homework is showing in the 40-50 range.
